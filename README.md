# Techsite frontend

I created this React app as a frontend to a backend I created myself. It displays a collection of techsites, mostly with focus on programming.

## Procedure

I started with creating a dataset, deploying it to Heroku and setting up a MongoDB for the project. I then set up this frontend in order to test my API, and to be able to show the data, since I think a good tech site resource is definitely something that could be of use to plenty of people. I've also published my API documentation here, so that all who wants to use the API can do so. 

## View it live

The deployed project can be seen here:
